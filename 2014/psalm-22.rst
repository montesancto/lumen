..

| The Lord is my shepherd;
|     there is nothing I shall want.
| Fresh and green are the pastures
|     where he gives me repose.
| Near restful waters he leads me,
|     to revive my drooping spirit.
|
| He guides me along the right path;
|     he is true to his name.
| If I should walk in the valley of darkness
|     no evil would I fear.
| You are there with your crook and your staff;
|     with these you give me comfort.
|
| You have prepared a banquet for me
|     in the sight of my foes.
| My head you have anointed with oil;
|     my cup is overflowing.
|
| Surely goodness and kindness shall follow me
|     all the days of my life.
| In the Lordâ€™s own house shall I dwell
|     for ever and ever.


Vulgate
-------

| in loco pascuae ibi me conlocavit super aquam refectionis educavit me
| animam meam convertit deduxit me super semitas iustitiae propter nomen suum
| nam et si ambulavero in medio umbrae mortis non timebo mala quoniam tu
| mecum es virga tua et baculus tuus ipsa me consolata sunt
| parasti in conspectu meo mensam adversus eos qui tribulant me inpinguasti
| in oleo caput meum et calix meus inebrians quam praeclarus est
| et misericordia tua subsequitur me omnibus diebus vitae meae
| et ut inhabitem in domo Domini in longitudinem dierum
