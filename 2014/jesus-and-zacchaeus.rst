He entered Jericho and was passing through. And there was a man named
Zacchae'us; he was a chief tax collector, and rich. And he sought to see who
Jesus was, but could not, on account of the crowd, because he was small of
stature. So he ran on ahead and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him,
for he was to pass that way. And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up
and said to him,

    “Zacchae'us, make haste and come down; for I must stay at
    your house today.”

So he made haste and came down, and received him joyfully. And when they saw
it they all murmured, “He has gone in to be the guest of a man who is a
sinner.” And Zacchae'us stood and said to the Lord, “Behold, Lord, half of
my goods I give to the poor; and if I have defrauded anyone of anything, I
restore it fourfold.” And Jesus said to him,

    “Today salvation has come to this house, since he also is a son of
    Abraham. For the Son of man came to seek and to save the lost.”
