| Stabat Mater dolorosa
| Iuxta crucem lacrimosa
| Dum pendebat Filius
| 
| Cuius animam gementem
| Contristatam et dolentem
| Pertransivit gladius
| 
| O quam tristis et afflicta
| Fuit illa benedicta
| Mater unigeniti!
| 
| Quae moerebat et dolebat,
| Pia Mater, dum videbat
| Nati poenas incliti
| 
| Quis est homo qui non fleret,
| Matrem Christi si videret
| In tanto supplicio?
| 
| Quis non posset contristari,
| Christi Matrem contemplari
| Dolentem cum Filio?
| 
| Pro peccatis suae gentis
| Vidit Iesum in tormentis,
| Et flagellis subditum.
| 
| Vidit suum dulcem natum
| Moriendo desolatum
| Dum emisit spiritum
| 
| Eia Mater, fons amoris 
| Me sentire vim doloris
| Fac, ut tecum lugeam
| 
| Fac, ut ardeat cor meum
| In amando Christum Deum
| Ut sibi complaceam
| 
| Sancta Mater, istud agas,
| Crucifixi fige plagas
| Cordi meo valide.
| 
| Tui nati vulnerati,
| Tam dignati pro me pati,
| Poenas mecum divide.
| 
| Fac me tecum, pie, flere,
| Crucifixo condolere,
| Donec ego vixero.
| 
| Iuxta crucem tecum stare,
| Et me tibi sociare
| In planctu desidero
| 
| Virgo virginum praeclara,
| Mihi iam non sis amara
| Fac me tecum plangere
| 
| Fac, ut portem Christi mortem
| Passionis fac consortem,
| Et plagas recolere.
| 
| Fac me plagis vulnerari,
| Fac me cruce inebriari,
| Et cruore Filii
| 
| Flammis ne urar succensus
| Per Te, Virgo, sim defensus
| In die iudicii
| 
| Christe, cum sit hinc exire,
| Da per Matrem me venire
| Ad palmam victoriae
| 
| Quando corpus morietur,
| Fac, ut animae donetur
| Paradisi gloria. Amen

The grieving Mother stood weeping beside the cross where her Son was hanging

Through her weeping soul, compassionate and grieving, a sword passed.

O how sad and afflicted was that blessed Mother of the Only-begotten!

Who mourned and grieved and trembled looking at the torment of her glorious Child

Who is the person who would not weep seeing the Mother of Christ in such agony?

Who would not be able to feel compassion on beholding Christ's Mother suffering with her Son?

For the sins of his people she saw Jesus in torment and subjected to the scourge.

She saw her sweet offspring dying, forsaken, while He gave up his spirit

O Mother, fountain of love, make me feel the power of sorrow, that I may grieve with you

Grant that my heart may burn in the love of Christ my Lord, that I may greatly please Him

Holy Mother, grant that the wounds of the Crucified drive deep into my heart.

That of your wounded Son, who so deigned to suffer for me, I may share the pain

Let me sincerely weep with you, bemoan the Crucified, for as long as I live

To stand beside the cross with you, and gladly share the weeping, this I desire

Chosen Virgin of virgins, be not bitter with me, let me weep with thee

Grant that I may bear the death of Christ, the fate of his Passion, and commemorate His wounds

Let me be wounded with his wounds, inebriated by the cross because of love for the Son

Inflame and set on fire, may I be defended by you, Virgin, on the day of judgement

Let me be guarded by the cross, armed by Christ's death and His grace cherish me

When my body dies, grant that to my soul is given the glory of paradise. Amen

| At the cross her station keeping,
|     stood the mournful mother weeping,
|     close to Jesus to the last
| Through her soul, of joy bereaved,
|     bowed with anguish, deeply grieved,
|     now at length the sword hath passed.
| O, that blessed one, grief-laden,
|     blessed Mother, blessed maiden, Mother of the all-holy One
| O that loving Mother's plight,
|     grieving to behold the sight of her glorious dying Son
| Who on Christ's dear Mother gazing, in her trouble so amazing,
|     born of woman, would not weep
| Who on Christ's dear Mother thinking,
|     Such a cup of sorrow drinking,
|     Would not share Her sorrow deep?
| For His people's sins in anguish,
|     there she saw the Victim languish,
|     bleed in torments, bleed and die
| Bruised, derided, cursed, defiled,
|     she beheld her tender child,
|     till His Spirit forth he sent.
| In the Passion of my Maker be my sinful soul partaker,
|     may I bear with her my part
| Make my heart to glow within me for the God who came to win me,
|     burn with love for Christ, my Lord
| Thou, who on the Cross art bearing all the pains I would be sharing,
|     glows my heart with love for Thee
| By Thy glorious Death and Passion,
|     saving me in wondrous fashion,
|     Saviour, turn my heart to Thee
| At Thy feet in adoration,
|     wrapped in earnest contemplation,
|     see, beneath Thy Cross I lie
| There, where all our sins Thou bearest in compassion fullest, rarest,
|     hanging on the bitter Tree
| Virgin, of all virgins blest,
|     O refuse not my request: let me in thy weeping share
| Make me after thine own fashion
|     Christ's companion in His Passion
|     all His pain and dying bear
| Wound me with thy Son's affliction,
|     kindle through his crucifixion zealous love within my soul
| Thus aflame with fire of love,
|     shield me, Virgin, from above,
|     when I hear the Judgement call
| Let the cross then be my guard,
|     the death of Christ my watch and ward,
|     and cherish me by heaven's grace
| When in death this body lies,
|     then fit my soul on high to rise to glory in His Paradise
