..

| Happy are those whose way is blameless,
|     who walk in the law of the Lord.
| Happy are those who keep his decrees,
|     who seek him with their whole heart,
| who also do no wrong,
|     but walk in his ways.
| You have commanded **your precepts**
|     to be kept diligently;
| O that my ways may be steadfast
|     in keeping **your statutes**!
| Then I shall not be put to shame,
|     having my eyes fixed on all **your commandments**.
| I will praise you with an upright heart,
|     when I learn **your righteous ordinances**.
| I will observe **your statutes**;
|     do not utterly forsake me.
