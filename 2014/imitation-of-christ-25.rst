    “Trust thou in the Lord and do good, dwell in the land and
    thou shalt feed on its riches.”

There is one thing that keeps many from zealously improving their lives, that
is, dread of the difficulty, the toil of battle. Certainly they who try
bravely to overcome the most difficult and unpleasant obstacles far outstrip
others in the pursuit of virtue. A man makes the most progress and merits the
most grace precisely in those matters wherein he gains the greatest victories
over self and most mortifies his will. True, each one has his own difficulties
to meet and conquer, but a diligent and sincere man will make greater progress
even though he have more passions than one who is more even-tempered but less
concerned about virtue.

Two things particularly further improvement—to withdraw oneself forcibly from
those vices to which nature is viciously inclined, and to work fervently for
those graces which are most needed.

Study also to guard against and to overcome the faults which in others very
frequently displease you. Make the best of every opportunity, so that if you
see or hear good example you may be moved to imitate it. On the other hand,
take care lest you be guilty of those things which you consider reprehensible,
or if you have ever been guilty of them, try to correct yourself as soon as
possible. As you see others, so they see you.

How pleasant and sweet to behold brethren fervent and devout, well mannered
and disciplined! How sad and painful to see them wandering in dissolution, not
practicing the things to which they are called! How hurtful it is to neglect
the purpose of their vocation and to attend to what is not their business!
Remember the purpose you have undertaken, and keep in mind the image of the
Crucified. Even though you may have walked for many years on the pathway to
God, you may well be ashamed if, with the image of Christ before you, you do
not try to make yourself still more like Him.

The religious who concerns himself intently and devoutly with our Lord’s most
holy life and passion will find there an abundance of all things useful and
necessary for him. He need not seek for anything better than Jesus.
If the Crucified should come to our hearts, how quickly and abundantly we
would learn!

A fervent religious accepts all the things that are commanded him and does
them well, but a negligent and lukewarm religious has trial upon trial, and
suffers anguish from every side because he has no consolation within and is
forbidden to seek it from without. The religious who does not live up to his
rule exposes himself to dreadful ruin, and he who wishes to be more free and
untrammeled will always be in trouble, for something or other will always
displease him.

How do so many other religious who are confined in cloistered discipline get
along? They seldom go out, they live in contemplation, their food is poor,
their clothing coarse, they work hard, they speak but little, keep long
vigils, rise early, pray much, read frequently, and subject themselves to all
sorts of discipline. Think of the Carthusians and the Cistercians,the
monks and nuns of different orders, how every night they rise to sing praise
to the Lord. It would be a shame if you should grow lazy in such holy service
when so many religious have already begun to rejoice in God.
If there were nothing else to do but praise the Lord God with all your heart
and voice, if you had never to eat, or drink, or sleep, but could praise God
always and occupy yourself solely with spiritual pursuits, how much happier
you would be than you are now, a slave to every necessity of the body! Would
that there were no such needs, but only the spiritual refreshments of the soul
which, sad to say, we taste too seldom!

When a man reaches a point where he seeks no solace from any creature, then he
begins to relish God perfectly. Then also he will be content no matter what
may happen to him. He will neither rejoice over great things nor grieve over
small ones, but will place himself entirely and confidently in the hands of
God, Who for him is all in all, to Whom nothing ever perishes or dies, for
Whom all things live, and Whom they serve as He desires.
Always remember your end and do not forget that lost time never returns.
Without care and diligence you will never acquire virtue. When you begin to
grow lukewarm, you are falling into the beginning of evil; but if you give
yourself to fervor, you will find peace and will experience less hardship
because of God’s grace and the love of virtue.

A fervent and diligent man is ready for all things. It is greater work to
resist vices and passions than to sweat in physical toil. He who does not
overcome small faults, shall fall little by little into greater ones.
If you have spent the day profitably, you will always be happy at eventide.
Watch over yourself, warn yourself, and regardless of what becomes of others,
do not neglect yourself. The more violence you do to yourself, the more
progress you will make.
