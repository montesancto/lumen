    Per ipsum et cum ipso et in ipso 
    est tibi Deo Patri omnipotenti:
    in unitate Spiritus Sancti,
    omnis honor et gloria

    -- Canon Missae

God is subsistent Being itself. The word 'being' applies strictly only to God.

    Deus solus vere essentiae nomen tenet - God alone has the name of true
    being.
    
    -- St. Jerome

For all other things, ourselves included, compared to that pure and
perfect substance, are not even shadows. That is why God gave his name when
speaking to Moses as *He who is (Exodus 3:14)*.

    Tam verum enim esse Deus habet, quod nostrum esse, suo comparatum, nihil
    est - so truly has God being, that our being, compared to his, is nothing.

    -- St. Bonaventure

God is one. He possesses unity, in a supereminent manner: or, more accurately,
he is unity itself, absolute simplicity. In him there is no distinction of
parts, no accident, no change.

    Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God is one Lord.

    -- Deuteronomy 4:4

None the less, this one God is three Persons. God is Father: he begets a Son
in a unity of nature, without division or change. And from the Father and the
Son proceeds equally the Holy Spirit. The Father is God, the Son is God, the
Holy Spirit is God; and these three are but one and the same God. This trinity
of Persons is no less necessary than the unity of being.

The Trinity is essential to God just as much as his divine nature. The divine
processions are not something added to his essence, already formed and
complete: they are the very substance, the very perfection of God. To be in
three Persons, Father, Son and Holy Spirit, is in reality the same as being
God, although our intellect cannot grasp the equivalence of these statements.
Both propositions, nevertheless, bear witness to the same necessity, and if we
are able to state them separately it is because we only know God in indirect
ways, in the obscurity of faith. We must be on our guard lest we attempt to
measure the mystery of the Trinity by the narrowness of our weak and
discursive concepts.

The divine eternity is as a changeless present, wherein the Father begets the
Son, and both breathe forth the Holy Spirit. St. Augustine compares the Son to
air, ever filled wity light, receiving at every moment a renewal without
change of the whole light of the sun. The divine generation did not take place
at the beginning of time, once and for all. It is a divine act, or rather it
is *the* divine act, eternal and unending, which never ceases and is never
interrupted, any more than is the divine Being from whom, in reality, it
cannot be distinguished. *Now* - at every moment of time - this act is being
accomplished: the Son is born of the Father.

    Ego hodie genui te - this day have I begotten thee.

    -- Psalm 2:7
